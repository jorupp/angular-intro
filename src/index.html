      </section>
      <section>
        <section>
          <p>Before we get to Angular in particular, let's talk about modern javascript frameworks in general and some terminology</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Common features of modern javascript frameworks</h2>
          <ul class="fragment">
            <li>Templating/data binding</li>
            <li>Change tracking/detection</li>
            <li>UI components</li>
            <li>Client-side Routing</li>
            <li>Dependency Injection</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="fragment">While talking about these Javascript frameworks, you'll also hear the term "SPA" thrown around.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>What is a "SPA"</h2>
          <p>A <u>S</u>ingle <u>P</u>age <u>A</u>pplication refers loading just one HTML page via the browser's normal approach, referring to JS and CSS from that page, and using AJAX for everything else.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>So, Angular is used to build SPAs?</h2>
          <p class="fragment">It can, but you don't have to.  SPA is one of your options.  Enhancing a server-delivered page is another equally viable option.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Other modern javascript frameworks</h2>
          <div class="fragment">
            <ul>
              <li>jQuery</li>
              <li>Knockout</li>
              <li>Backbone</li>
              <li>Ember</li>
              <li>React</li>
              <li>D3</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-size: x-small; text-align: right;">**Yes, there are many more....</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>One last thing to know: promises</h2>
          <p>Promises are a bit like .Net <code>Task</code>s - they're a placeholder for a value to arrive later.  Like <code>Task</code>s, promises can be chained:</p>
          <pre>
<code>$http.get('/url').then(
  function(result) { processData(result); }, 
  function(result) { $log.error('something broke'); 
});</code></pre>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <section>
          <h2>Enough generic stuff, what does Angular really offer?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>An engine that parses your HTML to execute "directives" and bind data based on your markup</li>
            <li>A facility for registering and resolving services and controllers</li>
            <li>
                Services and directives to help you build your application
                <ul>
                  <li>Routing</li>
                  <li>Validation</li>
                  <li>etc.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>But wait, there's more!</h2>
          <p class="fragment">Not really - that's all you need!</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <section>
          <h2>Data binding</h2>
          <div class="fragment">
            <pre>
              <code>&lt;span&gt;{{ vm.someValue }}&lt;/span&gt;</code>
            </pre>
            <p>Angular uses a similar syntax to <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars</a> or <a href="https://mustache.github.io/">Mustache</a></p>
            <p>Unlike some frameworks (like Knockout), Angular binds to bare values - no observable wrappers necessary.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Directives</h2>
          <p class="fragment">Directives manipulate the DOM based on data.</p>
          <div class="fragment">
            <pre><code>&lt;span ng-if="vm.someValue"&gt;Show me if vm.someValue is true&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>
            <p><code>ng-if</code> is one of many built-in directives.  It adds/removes the tag it is on from the DOM based on the value specified.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Services</h2>
          <p class="fragment">A service is a singleton object, and typically exposes a series of methods to be called by other components</p>
          <div class="fragment">
            <p>Typical functions of services:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Wrap <code>$http</code> to provide access to remote data</li>
              <li>Shared functionality (like the built-in <code>$locale</code> and <code>$log</code> services)</li>
              <li>Share state between other components (ie. a global filter control, or the built-in <code>$templateCache</code> service)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Controllers</h2>
          <p class="fragment">Controllers surface data and or methods for use with data binding and/or directives.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Some light, single-use business logic may be defined here, but most heavy is delegated to services to allow for more reuse.</p>
          <div class="fragment">
            <p>Because of how they are made available to the template/view for data binding, these can be likened to the view model in a MVVM approach.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 0.55em; text-align: right;">** Owen probably has some thoughts on this - I can't remember the details :(.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Modules</h2>
          <p>Modules are kind of a 'meh' feature in Angular 1.4.  They don't provide dynamic loading, they don't provide namespace isolation.</p>
          <p>All they seem to do is provide one more way to break your code (adding a reference to a libary and forgetting to reference it's module from your main module).</p>
          <p class="fragment">Counterpoints welcome.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Routing</h2>
          <p class="fragment">While routing may not be a core functional unit of Angular, it's a service every SPA will need to function</p>
          <p class="fragment">We'll be discussing angular-ui's router, not the built-in ngRoute.  Angular-ui-router is often sometimes call "new router" because it's going to eventually end up replacing ngRoute in 2.0, if not sooner.</p>
          <p class="fragment">Details coming in the example.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Dependency Injection</h2>
          <p>In addition to providing ways to build each of the pieces of your application, Angular provides an easy way to wire them all together.</p>
          <pre><code>angular.module('app').service('myService', function() { 
  return { 
    execute: function() { alert('hi'); } 
  }; 
});</code></pre>
          <p>Since I've defined <code>myService</code>, I can use it elsewhere:</p>
          <pre><code>angular.module('app').controller('myController', function(myService) { 
  myController.execute(); 
});</code></pre>
          <p class="fragment" style="font-size: small">Yes, this syntax isn't minification-safe, but it's easier to understand, you should use something like <code>ngAnnotate</code> at build time to handle that.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <section>
          <h1>Example time!!!</h1>
          <div class="fragment">
            <p><a href="http://localhost:4567/" target="_blank">Room Ninja</a> is a SPA written in Angular JS 1.4 with a ASP.Net WebAPI backend.</p>

          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Example checkup time</h2>
          <p>If ran through the example properly, you saw:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A routing registration (/settings)</li>
            <li>A controller (SettingsController)</li>
            <li>A view (settings.html)</li>
            <li>A service (settingsService)</li>
            <li>A custom directive (batteryMeter)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Change detection and $scope</h2>
          <p>In Angular, you're going to hear references to <code>$scope</code> (or just <code>scope</code>).  What is it?</p>
          <p class="fragment">In short, it's the magic bit of Angular that ties everything together and provides the basis for change tracking</p>
          <p class="fragment">At it's core, it's just a <code>$rootScope</code> object at the root of a tree of similar scope objects that cooperate to handle data binding and change tracking</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>So, how does this work?</h2>
          <p class="fragment current-visible">Magic :)</p>
          <div class="fragment">
            <p>Seriously though, it's all the magic of the <code>$digest()</code> cycle with <code>$watch()</code>es.</p>
            <p>With a reference to a <code>scope</code>, you can use the <code>$watch()</code> method to register a watch on a specific value, and run code in response to the change.</p>
            <p>At certain times (ie. after an event or data load), Angular starts a digest cycle, which checks all registered watches to see if any changed.  If so, it triggers the function registered with the changed watch, and repeat the cycle until no watches changed.</p>
          </div>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Wait, what?</h2>
          <pre><code>$scope.$watch('myValue', function() { /* do something */ })</code></pre>
          <p>When <code>myValue</code> on the scope changes, the provided function will run.</p>
          <p>Pass <code>true</code> as the third parameter for a deep watch (ie. using angular.equals for comparison).</p>
          <p>While you don't see it, data binding uses this internally (yes, even for one-time (<code>::value</code>) bindings)</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Digest vs. observable</h2>
          <p>Unlike observable-based approaches which react immediately, reactions are delayed until the next digest cycle, which can make it much easier to avoid value ping-pong with intricately-connected values.</p>
          <p>With observable-based approaches, each change to an observable with listeners has a cost, and no real way to 'batch' changes together</p>
          <p>With angular's approach, each <code>$digest</code> cycle has a cost based on the number of values being watched, but all changes apply immediately when executed with no need to batch them.</p>
        </section>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Angular 2.0</h2>
        <p>So, you've heard about Angular 2.0, eh?  Why should we learn Angular 1.4?  Why not learn Angular 2.0 instead?</p>
        <p class="fragment">Angular 2.0 doesn't exist - it's pre-alpha and the API changes frequently.</p>
        <p class="fragment">By following a few conventions, your code will be structured in a similar way to how it will need to be for 2.0, and can ease the learning/upgrade experience.</p>
